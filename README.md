# Teacher Appointments

A very simple application to manage teacher appointment with studens

## Description

This is a project base in one of my first project at the [FactoriaF5](https://github.com/FactoriaF5) bootcamp.
The [original project]() my team was asked to build a php vanilla application with the following requirements:
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application
- Object Oriented Programming following the MVC (Model, View, Controller) pattern.
Then we were also asked to add an API Controller that will return JSON response instead of rendering.

At the time and because we were learning about clean code namely the SOLID principles, I made a copy of the project and try to apply the Repository Pattern so I could easly switch from the back-end rended application to Rest API. This got forgot for months as I was learning and building other things. 
Now I want to take this project and refactor it in order to refresh my php vanilla skills.
