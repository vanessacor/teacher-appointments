# Teacher Appointments

A very simple application to manage teacher appointments with  the studens. A student creates an request for an appointment fill in his name and the subject it wants to discuss.

## Description

This is a project base in one of my first project at the [FactoriaF5](https://github.com/FactoriaF5) bootcamp.
In the [original project]() my team was asked to build a php vanilla application with the following requirements:
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application
- Object Oriented Programming following the MVC (Model, View, Controller) pattern.
Then we were also asked to add an API Controller that will return JSON response instead of rendering.

At the time and because we were learning about clean code namely the SOLID principles, I made a copy of the project and try to apply the Repository Pattern. This got forgot for months as I was learning and building other things. 
Now I want to take this project and refactor it in order to refresh my php vanilla skills.

### What need to do
- test coverage before refactoring
- add filter when displaying the appointments list to show just the upcomming ones
- sort by date the more less recent appointment to show first
